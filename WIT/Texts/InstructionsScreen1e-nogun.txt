In this task, you will see two images on each trial. The first image will be a face, and the second image will be an object. The face is not important, but only signals that the object is about to appear. When the object appears, it is your job to identify it as a <strong>gun</strong> or a <strong>tool</strong>. If the object is a gun, press the "i" key. If the object is a tool, press the "e" key.
</p>
<p>
Do your best to classify every object correctly! We want you to respond as quickly as you can, but <b>ABOVE ALL ELSE, TRY TO BE ACCURATE!</b>
</p>
<p>
After your response, the next trial will start automatically. This might feel fast at first, but keep paying attention! It will get easier.
</p>
<p>
If you are ready, place your fingers on the "e" and "i" keys, and press the space bar to begin.
